### Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide an overview and guide to existing open-source decentralized applications (dapps) and platforms for social interaction, social networking, social media, social engagement and creative or project-based collaboration (e.g. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).

For our purposes, **decentralized** means that these apps are peer-to-peer (P2P) and/or rely on decentralized infrastructure like public, open-source blockchains (e.g. Ethereum or Bitcoin) or protocols (e.g. IPFS, Secure Scuttlebut, Dat, Gun, WebTorrent, ActivityPub). If they rely on blockchains or protocols like these, it must be practically possible for users to run their own nodes without having to pay fees to any centralized entity.

_Decentralized_ apps and platforms are distinguished from _centralized_ ones (e.g. Facebook) that rely on centrally managed servers/databases and _federated_ ones that rely on a network of locally centralized servers (e.g. Mastodon).

Only _open-source_ apps and platforms will be listed here.

This is a curated list. More developed apps and platforms with more features and/or a wider user base may be highlighted, but all apps/platforms that meet the overall purpose will be listed here if submitted.

A question for all decentralized social networking and collaboration tools is how to pay for the underlying storage and computing cycles needed to support it. Some of the solutions below require you to pay (in one form or another) to "post" content or initiate an action. Others make no guarantees that your content will be available to others unless you host it yourself and keep your computer constantly on, and then people across the world may be only able to access it very slowly.


### Roadmap

This is a work in progress! Please help extend it and keep it up to date.

It is hoped that in the future a comparison of the various apps and platforms will be provided. Some of the criteria that will be worth highlighting are:
* Availability / use of encryption
* Privacy and management of personal data
* Underlying technologies used
* Adoption and use
* Level of maintenance and ongoing development
* License type
* Features provided
* Ability to do financial transactions
* Sponsors / contributors
* Degree of _lock in_ that prevents leaving or migrating from the app / platform
* Degree of integration available with other networks and tools
* Performance / speed
